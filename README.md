React application made in conjunction with Apollo-Express, and a google books RESTful API to find and save any book you want with a sleek single page application.

Refrectored to a GraphQL API server from the original repository here (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli), which was created as a RESTful API alongside the google books API.
